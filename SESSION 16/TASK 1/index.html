                                compliance requirements. We can make elements of IT greener, including hardware, software, data centers, and 
                                the Internet of Things. To make the entire life cycle of IT greener, we must address environmental impacts

                                agriculture, health care, and buildings greener. Software can be used, for example, to analyze, model, and 
                                simulate environmental impacts in areas such as manufacturing, logistics, and transportation. Algorithms could 
                                elp logistics firms optimize routes and manage fleets. Sensors and wireless sensor networks can facilitate 
                                collection of real-time data and improve efficiency in a range of applications.

                                    “There are several misconceptions in our communities that include healthy food being inaccessible, boring, or bland,” she says.

                                    “It can be so easy,” she says. “Canned beans, peanut butter, simmered lentils, brown rice, oatmeal, seasonal fruit, tons of veggies (frozen, canned, fresh).”
                                    Another major reason people struggle, or quit, after trying a plant-based diet is not being prepared, says Palmer.
